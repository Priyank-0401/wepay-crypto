# WePay Gas Optimization System - User Guide

Welcome to the WePay Gas Optimization System! This guide will walk you through the process of using our platform to save on Ethereum gas costs through transaction batching and optimization.

## What is WePay?

- **Secure Transaction Handling**: All transactions are securely processed and verified
- **Cross-Chain Support**: Send transactions across multiple blockchain networks
- **Layer 2 Integration**: Optimize transactions on popular Layer 2 scaling solutions
