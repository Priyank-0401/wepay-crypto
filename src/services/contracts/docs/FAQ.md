# WePay Gas Optimization System: Frequently Asked Questions

## General Questions

### What is WePay?
WePay is a gas optimization system designed to reduce Ethereum transaction costs through advanced batching techniques, cross-chain execution, and Layer 2 integration. By aggregating multiple user transactions into optimized batches, we significantly reduce the gas costs associated with blockchain interactions.

### How does WePay work?
WePay works by collecting multiple user transactions, analyzing them for optimization opportunities, and then executing them in batches at the most cost-effective times. The system utilizes smart contract proxies to maintain security while enabling these optimizations.

### Who can benefit from using WePay?
Anyone who regularly interacts with Ethereum or other supported blockchains can benefit from WePay. This includes:
- Regular users performing token transfers
- DeFi users executing swaps and liquidity provision
- NFT collectors and creators
- DAOs conducting governance operations
- DApp developers looking to reduce user costs

### Which blockchains does WePay support?
WePay primarily focuses on Ethereum mainnet but also supports:
- Optimism
- Arbitrum
- Polygon
- Binance Smart Chain
- More chains are added regularly based on community demand

## Using WePay

### How do I get started with WePay?
Getting started is simple:
1. Connect your wallet to the WePay interface
2. Deposit funds you wish to use for transactions
3. Submit your transactions through the WePay interface
4. Monitor their execution in real-time
5. Withdraw remaining funds at any time

### Do I need to hold a WePay token to use the service?
No, WePay is designed to be accessible to everyone without requiring any specific token holdings. The system charges fees based on gas savings rather than token ownership.

### How much can I save on gas fees?
Typical gas savings range from 40-70% compared to individual transaction execution, depending on:
- The type of transaction
- Current network conditions
- Batch size
- Transaction urgency

### How does priority work?
WePay offers three priority levels:
- **Standard**: Transactions are executed within 5-20 minutes for maximum gas savings
- **Priority**: Transactions are executed within 1-5 minutes with moderately reduced savings
- **Urgent**: Transactions are executed in the next block with minimum savings

### Is there any limit on transaction types?
WePay supports most standard transaction types including:
- ETH and token transfers
- Contract interactions (swaps, staking, etc.)
- NFT minting and trading
- Custom contract calls

Some highly specialized or gas-intensive operations may have limitations.

## Security

### Is WePay non-custodial?
Yes, WePay implements a non-custodial architecture. User funds remain under user control through proxy contracts. The optimizer can only execute user-authorized transactions, and users can withdraw their funds at any time.

### How secure is WePay?
WePay prioritizes security through:
- Comprehensive smart contract audits by leading security firms
- Formal verification of critical components
- Open-source code for community review
- Bug bounty programs
- Regular security assessments

### What happens if a transaction in a batch fails?
Each transaction in a batch is executed independently, so if one transaction fails, others will still proceed. Failed transactions are refunded to the user's WePay balance (minus a small processing fee).

### What if WePay is compromised?
WePay's non-custodial architecture ensures that even if the system were compromised:
- User funds couldn't be withdrawn to unauthorized addresses
- Only user-approved transaction types could be executed
- Emergency circuit breakers would prevent mass exploitation
- Multi-signature controls require multiple authorized parties for system changes

### Has WePay been audited?
Yes, WePay's smart contracts have undergone multiple security audits by leading firms including:
- Chain Security
- OpenZeppelin
- Quantstamp
- Trail of Bits

All audit reports are publicly available in our GitHub repository.

## Technical Details

### How is gas optimization achieved?
WePay uses multiple techniques to reduce gas costs:
- **Transaction batching**: Combining multiple transactions into single contract calls
- **Calldata optimization**: Minimizing the data required for transactions
- **Gas price timing**: Executing during periods of lower network congestion
- **Layer 2 routing**: Directing transactions to the most cost-effective chains
- **Contract optimization**: Using specialized contracts for common operations

### What's the difference between WePay and other gas savers?
Unlike simple gas price calculators or basic batching solutions, WePay provides:
- Cross-chain execution options
- Advanced batching algorithms
- Non-custodial security model
- Priority-based execution
- Comprehensive transaction support
- Layer 2 integration

### Can I cancel a pending transaction?
Yes, transactions that haven't yet been included in a batch can be cancelled with a full refund. Transactions already included in a pending batch may be cancellable with a small fee, depending on the batch status.

### What happens during network congestion?
During high congestion periods, WePay:
- Adjusts batch timing to find optimal gas prices
- May route transactions to Layer 2 solutions when appropriate
- Prioritizes urgent transactions while queuing standard ones
- Provides users with options to increase priority if needed

## Economic Model

### How does WePay make money?
WePay's economic model is based on fee sharing:
- The system takes a percentage (typically 30%) of the gas saved compared to individual execution
- A minimal base fee (0.05% of transaction value) covers operational costs
- Optional priority fees for expedited processing

### Are there any hidden fees?
No, all WePay fees are transparent and displayed before transaction confirmation. The fee structure ensures users always save gas compared to individual execution.

### How is the fee calculated?
Fees are calculated using the formula:
```
Fee = BaseFee + (GasSaved * SavingsFeeRate) + PriorityFee
```
Where:
- BaseFee = TransactionValue * 0.0005
- GasSaved = (EstimatedIndividualGas - BatchedGas) * CurrentGasPrice
- SavingsFeeRate = 0.3 (30%)
- PriorityFee depends on chosen priority level

### Can I stake or earn rewards with WePay?
While WePay doesn't have its own token, the system does offer a rewards program for:
- Users providing liquidity for cross-chain operations
- Governance participants helping improve the protocol
- Referrals bringing new users to the platform

## Governance and Future

### How is WePay governed?
WePay utilizes a decentralized governance model where:
- Community proposals can be submitted for protocol improvements
- Voting on proposals determines implementation
- A technical council oversees security-critical changes
- Fee parameter adjustments require community approval

### What's on the WePay roadmap?
Future developments include:
- ZK-proof integration for enhanced privacy
- Account abstraction for improved UX
- MEV protection mechanisms
- Integration with emerging L2 technologies
- Expanded cross-chain support
- Enhanced developer tools and APIs

### How can I contribute to WePay?
You can contribute to WePay by:
- Participating in governance discussions

- Contributing to code if you're a developer
- Providing liquidity for cross-chain operations

### Will WePay have its own token?
While not currently implemented, a governance token may be introduced in the future based on community demand and protocol requirements.
